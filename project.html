        <p>Although my original plan was to 3d print my blender model, I had some difficulties accounting for time to schedule a consultation and print time. So I modified my project to be a proposed design for a 3d printed planter.</p>

    <section id="analysis">
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>Overall, my future systems project offers a small scale solution to a large scale problem, yet it is effective at the individual and community level.The aesthetic of my project is minimal and practical because I wanted the vision to be easy to recreate and implement at a more widespread scale.  </p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, my 3d model is more of a proposal and prototype than a finished product. 
            However I feel that the design highlights accessibility to the public and sustainable manufacturing processes, all of which reflects back on my key concept of sustainable lifestyle  choices.</p>
